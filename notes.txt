	First of all find the pivot element(A pivot element is the one jiske just aage aur just piche dono small elements honge). 
	Once the pivot element is found now check if the target element is smaller that 0th element then the element should be present
	in between 0 to pivot-1 else the element must be between pivot+1 to n-1 else -1.

	So now perform binary search for all these two cases.
